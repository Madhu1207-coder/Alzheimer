## Real-time streaming (SSE)

Note: Live streaming features were removed from the default Biomarker dashboard UI. A development SSE helper remains in the repository (not enabled by default). If you want streaming re-enabled or production-grade pub/sub, I can add server-side persistence and pub/sub integration.
